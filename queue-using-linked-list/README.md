# QUEUE IMPLEMENTATION OF LINKED LIST:
In a Queue data structure, we maintain two pointers, front and rear. The front points the first item of queue and rear points to last item.

## BASIC OPERATIONS:
- __enQueue():__ This operation adds a new node after rear and moves rear to the next node.
- __deQueue():__ This operation removes the front node and moves front to the next node.
