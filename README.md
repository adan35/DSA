SINGLY LINKED LIST:
A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from start to the last node.
Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
The first node is called the start; it points to the first node of the list and helps us access every other element in the list.

Common Singly Linked List Operations:
-> insertion
-> deletion
-> search
-> traversal
