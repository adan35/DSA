# LINKED LIST IMPLEMENTATION OF STACK
Implement a stack using single linked list concept. all the single linked list operations perform based on Stack operations 
LIFO(last in first out) and with the help of that knowledge we are going to implement a stack using single linked list. us-
ing single linked lists so how to implement here it is linked list means what we are storing the information in the form of
nodes and we need to follow the stack rules.

## BASIC OPERATIONS:
- **push():** Inserts item to top node of linked list.
- __pop():__ Returns the top node of the linked list, 2nd node will become top node.
- __peek():__ Returns the top node of the linked list
- __display():__ Print all items of the stack
