# QUEUE
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between
stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently 
added.
